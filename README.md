Note: This code is able to achieve a 5th place score (Private LB: 0.008776). But this is not a full version of my submitted solution (Private LB: 0.008905). My submitted solution is average of this solution and another XGBoost solution. This repositoy provides a simple version of 5th place solution. 

## Dependency (development environment)

- OS: Ubuntu 14.04
- Python: 2.7
- pip: numpy(1.9), scipy, pandas, sklearn-pandas, chainer
